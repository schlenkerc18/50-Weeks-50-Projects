# 50-Weeks-50-Projects

The inspiration behind this project was to become a Machine Learning Expert.  Every week I find a new dataset to explore.  I start by investigating the dataset, and then I choose a Machine Learning model based on that data! 
Every week I try to do something a little different, whether that's applying a recently learned Machine Learning algorithm to a dataset or applying interesting machine learning methods that I haven't tried before.

These 50 Projects are essentially documenting my journey from a Machine Learning Novice to a Machine Learning Expert.  Not every project is perfect, but they get better every week!
